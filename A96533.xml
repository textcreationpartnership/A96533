            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou haÅ¿t here preÅ¿ented to thine own, and the publick view, three diÅ¿tinct treatiÅ¿es, written upon Å¿everal Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and Å¿everal occaÅ¿ions; But becauÅ¿e they have all one Author, and were not much different in time, and eÅ¿pecially becauÅ¿e (though they Å¿eem Å¿trangers in their
<pb facs="tcp:119672:3"/>Titles) yet there is a kinde of affinitie in the Å¿ubject matter of them, as being all deÅ¿cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, of Å¿everal parts and provinces, and bearing equal Marks of judgement, and pollicie in affaires of Å¿tate. It was thought fit to binde them up together, that Å¿o they might become more conÅ¿iderable in the Å¿ale, to him that was to bear the charge of printing them, and likewiÅ¿e yeeld more variety of pleaÅ¿ure and content, if not of profit and advantage to the judicious Reader: for though it hath been Å¿aid by Å¿ome, that things of this nature, when once they are known do loÅ¿e the eÅ¿timati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:119672:3"/>we had of them before, yet certainly an active un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tanding man will finde a way to enlarge his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by the uÅ¿e of them, upon future occaÅ¿ions, when they Å¿hall be offered. For otherwiÅ¿e, what benefit Å¿hal we reap by HiÅ¿tory, diÅ¿cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es of al kinds, or any practick knowledge, which we Å¿hall attain unto? though both the State of theÅ¿e Provinces and the affairs, and relations of the World, as to them, have Å¿uffered many great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, Å¿ince theÅ¿e treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es were written, yet Å¿uch are the continual viciÅ¿Å¿itude, and changes of all Å¿ublunarie things, as though it be not
<pb facs="tcp:119672:4"/>probable we Å¿hall ever Å¿ee them Å¿etled in all points as they were before, yet may they come Å¿o neer either in the Å¿ame, or other parts, as that theÅ¿e obÅ¿ervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may Å¿erve as land-marks by which we may Å¿teer our courÅ¿e in the like conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.</p>
            <p>The Author of all theÅ¿e three treatiÅ¿es was Sir <hi>IÅ¿aac Wake,</hi> a man of exquiÅ¿ite hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning, Å¿trong parts of nature, and a moÅ¿t refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wit, able to penetrate into the depth of things, and give a judgement on them, grounded upon Å¿olid reaÅ¿on: TheÅ¿e parts, both of nature and learning, aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ted with a
<pb facs="tcp:119672:4"/>neat expreÅ¿Å¿ion of his own conceptions, not onely in the Latine tongue (wherein he was excellent) but alÅ¿o in the vulgar languages, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a logical inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made all his compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ures not onely Methodical, but pleaÅ¿ing and perÅ¿picuous</p>
            <p>To all theÅ¿e may be added, as the Crown of all, his long experience in affaires of Å¿tate, as having been many yeers emploied an AmbaÅ¿Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour abroad to forreign Princes, both by king <hi>James,</hi> and the late king <hi>Charles,</hi> wherein he behaved himÅ¿elf Å¿o dexterouÅ¿ly, &amp; judiciouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as not onely gave ful Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to his MaÅ¿ters, but
<pb facs="tcp:119672:5"/>procured him love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect from all thoÅ¿e Princes, and Republicks, with whom he was to negotiate, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed him to that credit, and reputation amongÅ¿t them which did much facillitate the expedition of affaires to his MaÅ¿ters honor (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was ever moÅ¿t Jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) and his own deÅ¿erved-commendation. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may obÅ¿erve in the firÅ¿t of theÅ¿e treatieÅ¿es, a particular example of his admirable dexterity, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediting the moÅ¿t intricate affaires, when they were held almoÅ¿t inextricable. That Gordion knot (as he calls it) about the <hi>Pais de
<pb facs="tcp:119672:5"/>Vaud,</hi> which (notwithÅ¿tand the interpoÅ¿ition of moÅ¿t of the potent Princes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tendom) continued fourty years, without finding any man that could unlooÅ¿e it, was by his miniÅ¿tery, and not ordinary endeavour, at laÅ¿t untied; and though he out of ModeÅ¿tie and dutie, aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe all this (and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervedly) to the wiÅ¿dom and felicity of his MaÅ¿ters Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us: yet the judicions reader may obÅ¿erve that excellent <hi>temperamentum</hi> to which this difficult buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced through the ripeneÅ¿Å¿e of his Wit and judgement, wherby it was at laÅ¿t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed.
<pb facs="tcp:119672:6"/>Having Å¿aid thus much of the worthy Author (of whom much more might yet be Å¿aid, if it were fit to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erted in a Preface.) There will be no need to Å¿peak much of the treatiÅ¿es them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, their own worth wil bring both delight and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the obÅ¿erving Reader. The firÅ¿t of them may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps appear to him the moÅ¿t exact and perfect deÅ¿cripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoÅ¿e parts, which hath hitherto been offered to the publick view.</p>
            <p>The Å¿econd was peculiarly proper to our induÅ¿trious Author, whoÅ¿e conÅ¿tant courÅ¿e it was, upon all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable changes, and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb facs="tcp:119672:6"/>either at home or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the Provinces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his charge, to give a Å¿um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary relation of all affaires tranÅ¿acted there, and of their ends and intereÅ¿ts, who Å¿at at the Å¿tern to guide them, by which means his MaÅ¿ters and their MiniÅ¿ters of Å¿tate at home, received great light and information, how to Å¿teer their courÅ¿e, and give directions to their publick MiniÅ¿ters abroad. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which accrues from theÅ¿e general relations, is remarkable in the Å¿tate of Venice, whoÅ¿e AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors are bound to give an exact account to that grave, and wary Senate, of the
<pb facs="tcp:119672:7"/>Condition and intereÅ¿ts of all thoÅ¿e Provinces where they reÅ¿ide, and when they return home, to give a full relation in writing, of the State and condition of thoÅ¿e parts, as they Å¿tood when they departd from them, and theÅ¿e are carefully kept in Archivis for their future uÅ¿e and information.</p>
            <p>The laÅ¿t of theÅ¿e three diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿es (it muÅ¿t be confeÅ¿t) may Å¿eem imperfect, yet is it compoÅ¿ed with Å¿o much Å¿ound judgement grounded upon reaÅ¿on, and experience as may give the dilignt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a full and perfect view, of the Motives which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wadeded, and the ends to
<pb facs="tcp:119672:7"/>which the proceedings of that glorious king of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> were directed. It hath ben held a piece of policie in the Ancients, to leave all their great and magnificent works in Å¿ome one part or other unfiniÅ¿hed, that Å¿o there might be <hi>DeÅ¿ideratum quid</hi> Å¿omething for deÅ¿ire to long after, and wiÅ¿h for, till it be Å¿atiÅ¿fied, the want whereof, works is us Å¿o great an eÅ¿timation of that which appears admirable in it Å¿elf, as that it Å¿eems a pittie, that it was not brought to ful perfection. But when once the minde of man is fully Å¿atisfied, our admiration ceaÅ¿eth, and with it the
<pb facs="tcp:119672:8"/>value, and eÅ¿teem of that which once we did admire; it cannot be reaÅ¿onably Å¿uppoÅ¿ed, that in Å¿o Å¿hort &amp; Å¿uccinct a piece as this, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Å¿uch ambition could cauÅ¿e the Author to leave it imperfect; But yet the want of that which Å¿hould have been the concluÅ¿ion and application of the whole diÅ¿courÅ¿e, may haply Å¿tir up Å¿ome active brain, to Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that defect, and it may perhaps be thought no point of defficulty, for one acquainted with thoÅ¿e times out of theÅ¿e premiÅ¿es, to draw a right concluÅ¿ion. Onely it is to be feared, that it may prove like that

               <hi>Capo di venere</hi> (as the Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans tearm it) that unparra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leld <hi>Head of Venus,</hi> cut out, and delineated with exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ite Art and Beauty by that rare Å¿tatuarie, who inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to have fitted the whole body to it, but was prevented by death: and though there were then, and bave been Å¿ince, many excellent ArtiÅ¿ts in that kinde, yet Å¿uch was the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and admirable Å¿culpture of that <hi>Head,</hi> that no man ever after, durÅ¿t put a hand to finiÅ¿h what was left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
            <p>However (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) if thou finde either Content, or profit in this

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119672:16"/>the firÅ¿t league, which they did get to be extended more to their advantage then the intent was at the firÅ¿t, and in particular they obtained a Å¿pecification of the paÅ¿Å¿age to be granted through the State of the Cantons, for al Å¿trangers whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi> Å¿hould have occaÅ¿ion to leavy for his Å¿ervice in <hi>Italy.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> AmbaÅ¿Å¿ador did Å¿trongly oppoÅ¿e againÅ¿t that declaration at that time, but all that he could obtain was a reÅ¿ervation of the right of the <hi>French</hi> King, and that the Å¿aid declaration Å¿hould be underÅ¿tood not to prejudice in any thing the Alliance that the <hi>French</hi> King hath with that people.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:119672:19"/>Å¿hall require it. The birth of this league may be called <hi>partus elephantinus,</hi> in regard that it had been treated forty year before it could be concluded. The French King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth did interpoÅ¿e himÅ¿elf twice as an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but could not bring it to concluÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; The whole body of the Helvetical Cantons, did imbrace it likewiÅ¿e divers times, but could never prevail, and laÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was referred unto the ValeÅ¿ani, as to a Republick neareÅ¿t confining, and Å¿trictly allied with both the parties, yet after many years negotiation, and much paines they could effect nothing. In the year above named 1617. King <hi>James</hi> of glorious memory did interpoÅ¿e his authority, and as he had a particular genius which did incline him to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the accommodation of all miÅ¿un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tandings among all ChriÅ¿tian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and States, Å¿o God did miraculouÅ¿Å¿y bleÅ¿Å¿e thoÅ¿e pious intentions of his, and in this particular his MajeÅ¿ty had the honour not onely to extinguiÅ¿h that mortal hatred which had raigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove 60 yeares, betwixt the houÅ¿e of <hi>Savoy</hi> and that State, but to joyn and unite them in a Å¿trict bond of league and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:119672:19"/>Allyance. The tranÅ¿action of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ineÅ¿Å¿e in it Å¿elf is very conÅ¿iderable, in regard that Å¿o many had Å¿o long time travelled in that vineyard, and never reaped any fruit of honour, whereas his MajeÅ¿tie employing his Å¿ervant Sir <hi>IÅ¿aae Wake</hi> thither in <hi>March,</hi> the Treaty was concluded ratified, and executed before the end of <hi>Iune.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Gordian knot, which was thought would have required the Å¿word of <hi>Alexander</hi> to cut, before it could be undone, was tied in this manner. In the time of <hi>Charles le bon</hi> grandfather to the preÅ¿ent Duke of <hi>Savoy, Charles</hi> the fift, and <hi>Francis</hi> the firÅ¿t warring one againÅ¿t the other, did <hi>par droict de bien ieame,</hi> Å¿hare and divide betwixt themÅ¿elves almoÅ¿t all <hi>Pied-mont,</hi> Å¿o that little being left unto the good Duke <hi>Charls,</hi> but <hi>Savoy</hi> and the Countey of <hi>NiÅ¿la</hi> in Province, he was inforced for the Å¿upply of his urgent neceÅ¿Å¿ities to borrow a conÅ¿iderable Å¿um of money of the SÅ¿<hi rend="sup">ri</hi>. of <hi>Berne,</hi> unto whom he did impawn for their reimburÅ¿ment the Countrey of <hi>Vaud.</hi> After his death his Å¿on <hi>Emanuel Philibert</hi> having little to maintain himÅ¿elf at home, did adhere
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119672:20"/>unto <hi>Philp</hi> the Å¿econd, of whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved Å¿o wel in the Battle of S. <hi>Quintin,</hi> that the King was content to reÅ¿tore unto him that he did hold of his in <hi>Pied-mont,</hi> and becauÅ¿e he married the Lady <hi>Margarite de Valois</hi> daughter of <hi>France,</hi> in contemplation of her. <hi>Henry</hi> the third paÅ¿Å¿ing through <hi>Pied-mont,</hi> as he returned out of <hi>Polonia,</hi> reÅ¿tored unto him likewiÅ¿e all that the French had uÅ¿urped: yet was not this Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with this addition to his fortune to redeem the ingagement of the <hi>pais de Vaud,</hi> and being willing to enjoy quietly that which he had, he did confirm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the BerneÅ¿i, the morgage made by his father, Å¿o that they did live in peace during his time, though not without great jealouÅ¿ies, in regard of the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the Savoyards their confining neighbours, who had alwayes had them in deteÅ¿tation Å¿ince the morgage of that Province.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> now regnant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born under a Martial Planet, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Å¿agittarius aÅ¿cendant</hi> in his nativity, did affright the BerneÅ¿i at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and not long after it did appear that they did not fear him in vain, for he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119672:20"/>did preÅ¿ently caÅ¿t his eye upon the <hi>Pais de Vaud,</hi> and becauÅ¿e he could not abruptly break the contract of Morgage made by his Granfather, and ratified by his father, and was not able to pay the principal and intereÅ¿t, which in Å¿o many years was grown to a great Å¿um, he did lay his firÅ¿t claim to the Town of <hi>Geneva,</hi> in the defence of which Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the BerneÅ¿i being ingaged, they were of neceÅ¿Å¿ity to declare themÅ¿elves his enemies, and Å¿o miniÅ¿ter unto him a fit occaÅ¿ion of invading them, which was the thing that he did aime at, and he had fortune Å¿o favourable, that in the year 83. as I take it, he did Å¿hut them up Å¿o cloÅ¿e in <hi>Cologne,</hi> a Town three miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tant from <hi>Geneva,</hi> near the <hi>RoÅ¿ne,</hi> that they were inforced to yeeld them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves to his diÅ¿cretion. If falÅ¿e friends had Å¿econded his true valour, it would have gone hard with <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Berne</hi> both at that time. But the Spaniards upon whom he did wholy rely, at that time deÅ¿iring onely to imbroyl and conÅ¿ume him a <hi>petit feu,</hi> and not to make any addition unto his fortune, did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him from proÅ¿ecuting that deÅ¿igne, and turn him with his Army upon the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119672:21"/>conqueÅ¿t of <hi>MarÅ¿eilles</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> during the combuÅ¿tions of the league in <hi>France.</hi> After he had wearied himÅ¿elf there, they did animate him to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queÅ¿t of the MarquiÅ¿ate of <hi>Salulles,</hi> which did Å¿ucceed to his advantage in <hi>Italy,</hi> but to his loÅ¿Å¿e on the other Å¿ide of the hills, drawing upon him the victorious arms of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, who did inforce him to exchange <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lulles</hi> with the Bailliages of <hi>BreÅ¿Å¿e, BaugÃ³ VerommÃ¨</hi> and <hi>Gez,</hi> which were the beÅ¿t flowers in the garden of <hi>Savoy.</hi> Now were the BerneÅ¿i out of danger, thoÅ¿e confining Provinces being out of his hands, and their Å¿tate in the protection of the French King, whom they had aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿Å¿iÅ¿ted during his troubles, both with men and money: yet did their jealouÅ¿ies Å¿till continue, until the invaÅ¿ion of <hi>Monferrat Anno</hi> 1613. did draw upon the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> the arms of the king of <hi>Spain,</hi> which did enter into <hi>Pied-ment</hi> firÅ¿t <hi>Anno</hi> 1615. under the conduct of <hi>Don Gio: di Mendoza</hi> Marquis of <hi>Hyntioza,</hi> and Å¿econdly <hi>Anno</hi> 1617. under the command of <hi>Don Pedro di Toledo:</hi> it was time now for the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to Å¿eek for help from all places, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:119672:21"/>therefore deÅ¿pairing of ever recovering the <hi>pais de Vaud,</hi> he was contented to give over a loÅ¿t game, upon condition that he might get Å¿ome reaÅ¿onable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ideration, for his reÅ¿ignation. Here is the knot which I mentioned, for he did pretend much, and the BerneÅ¿i would not give any thing, alledging that they would not buy that which was their own already. Towards the untying of this knot, the authority of his MajeÅ¿ty was uÅ¿ed, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> imploring, and the BerneÅ¿i accepting of his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: means was found to reconcile theÅ¿e contradictions, with mutual Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, for the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> did receive as much as he could with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on expect, and yet the BerneÅ¿i did not Å¿tipulate with him for any thing; the expedient taken was this. The Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿i were deÅ¿ired to concur with his MajeÅ¿tie in the aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> againÅ¿t the violence and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿Å¿ion of the Spaniards, and in conÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration thereof his MajeÅ¿tie did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e and undertake to give them a final and total reÅ¿ignation of the <hi>Pais de Vaud,</hi> free from any future claim or pretention. To gratifie his MajeÅ¿tie,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:119672:22"/>the BerneÅ¿i did Å¿end unto the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> four thouÅ¿and men payed by them for three moneths, and in requital of this favour Sir <hi>IÅ¿aac Wake</hi> did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent unto them two formal Acts, the one of the Duke, and the other of the Prince of <hi>Pied-mont,</hi> which did contain an abÅ¿olute ceÅ¿Å¿ion of all future claims or pretentions by any of that houÅ¿e to the <hi>pais de Vaud.</hi> This point being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated the treaty of Alliance was inÅ¿tantly concluded, but neither in the preface nor in the Articles was there any mention made of the Å¿uccours Å¿ent by the BerneÅ¿i, or of the reÅ¿ignation of the <hi>pais de Vaud,</hi> it being an Act paÅ¿Å¿ed meerly by his MajeÅ¿tie without any mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Å¿tipulation of the parties, and as the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Pied-mont</hi> did truÅ¿t Sir <hi>IÅ¿aac Wake</hi> with their ReÅ¿ignations, Å¿o did the BerneÅ¿i give likewiÅ¿e unto him four thouÅ¿and men to diÅ¿poÅ¿e of, as his MajeÅ¿tie Å¿hould be pleaÅ¿ed to command, and Å¿o all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences were accommodated with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal contentment of both the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and with much honour to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeÅ¿tie, who had no partner in this work, but the God of peace, whom he did

                     <p>Secondly the neighbourhood of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the vicinity of the French Countrey of <hi>Burgandis,</hi> is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thorn in the Å¿ide of that body; although <hi>Spain</hi> of it Å¿elf doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any thing that way, yet being head of the <hi>AuÅ¿trian</hi> family, they have a principal intereÅ¿t in al that doth belong unto that houÅ¿e, and if that were not Å¿o (as is too evident) yet the natural inclination and genius which that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath, <hi>dilatare fines imperij,</hi> doth draw upon them an envious reputation of being ill neigbours, beÅ¿ides that the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of that Monarchy doth bring it within the compaÅ¿Å¿e of the Italian proverb, which doth forbid a man to dwell neer four F. namely, <hi>Frati, Fiumi, Forni and Forti,</hi> and by conÅ¿equence greatly injealous all the SwiÅ¿Å¿es, who have the laÅ¿t F. at their door.

                     </p>
                     <p>TheÅ¿e are the main jealouÅ¿ies, with which that whole body is troubled, and indeed all that I can remember, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> being not to be Å¿poken of in this place, in regard that <hi>Geneva</hi> is not numbered among the Cantons.</p>
                     <p>The particular miÅ¿underÅ¿tandings are Å¿o much the more to be fear'd, as internal miÅ¿chiefes are more dangerous then external; they are many, and have Å¿everal branches, but may be reduced all unto one head, and that is an alienation of affections, hatred and rancor cauÅ¿ed by their diviÅ¿ion, in matter of religion. This fatal diÅ¿traction hath bred a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal faction, in which moÅ¿t of the Princes of ChriÅ¿tendom have part, the <hi>Pope,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and <hi>Spain</hi> openly fomenting, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> favouring the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick party, and all the reformed Princes and States, wiÅ¿hing well unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tant Å¿ide. TheÅ¿e latter have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther motive but pure zeal, and a deÅ¿ire of the preÅ¿ervation of that true religion
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119672:24"/>whereof they do make profeÅ¿Å¿ion, the orthodox Helvetians being a principal member of the reformed Church, and having like a Seminary produced men of extraotdinary learning and zeal, who have laboured in the vineyard of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, with much paines and great profit to the Church, Å¿uch as were <hi>Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inglius, Oecolampdius, Simler, HoÅ¿pinian, WaÅ¿er,</hi> and many others who for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of Å¿ouls, do now Å¿hine in heaven, like Å¿tars in the firmament. ThoÅ¿e who do foment the Catholicks, have divers ends, for although it may be preÅ¿umed that the <hi>Pope</hi> doth intend nothing but the reduction of that whole body to the obedience of the Å¿ea of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein likewiÅ¿e there is Å¿o much mixture of worldly reÅ¿pect, as the increaÅ¿e of Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Faires and Markets, do fill his coffers by the vent of his indulgences and pardons, yet it is certain, that the Emperour and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> have <hi>ragione di Å¿tato,</hi> which doth move them to adhere and take part with the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Cantons. For beÅ¿ides that thoÅ¿e diviÅ¿ions and factions, are like the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>SamÅ¿ons</hi> locks, the Å¿trength of that body conÅ¿iÅ¿ting in union, as his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:119672:25"/>did in his hair, if at any time they can prevail Å¿o far, as to kindle a war in thoÅ¿e parts grounded upon religion, they will Å¿oon make an end of the quarrel, by Å¿et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon both, parties when they have weakened one another; this deÅ¿igne is Å¿o well grounded, that it may perhaps rake effect in time, for Å¿ince the reception of the JeÅ¿uits in <hi>Iucerne</hi> and <hi>Friburg,</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerbations have daily increaÅ¿ed, and nothing but the fear of a foreign enemy doth keep them now from a civil war. From this original fountain of habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diÅ¿Å¿ention, grounded upon difference in religion, are derived many Å¿mal Å¿treams of diÅ¿cord, which inereaÅ¿ing the miÅ¿underÅ¿tandings of thoÅ¿e people, are with much artifice cultivated by thoÅ¿e who for Å¿piritual or temporal reÅ¿pects, deÅ¿ire to trouble thoÅ¿e waters: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not particularize in all, becauÅ¿e ever and anon the Catholicks do make by the inÅ¿tigation of their partiÅ¿ans, and their own natural inclination, <hi>une querelle d' Allemande,</hi> againÅ¿t the ProteÅ¿tants in which they do get nothing, becauÅ¿e they do meet with men that do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand reaÅ¿on, &amp; will not be out braved, but I will point at three iÅ¿Å¿ues which I
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119672:25"/>have obÅ¿erved in that body, that do run perpetually, and will hardly be Å¿topped, depending all of them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firÅ¿t head of diviÅ¿ion in matter of Religion.</p>
                     <p>The firÅ¿t is a difference betwixt <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> and <hi>Friburg,</hi> who have four Baillia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in common, which they do govern alternatively in this manner, that when <hi>Berne</hi> doth name the MagiÅ¿trate, he is bound to take his oath at <hi>Friburg,</hi> and when <hi>Friburg</hi> doth nominate him, he is to do the like at <hi>Berne,</hi> The names of theÅ¿e Bailliages, are <hi>Murate, GranÅ¿one, Å¿warÅ¿bourg,</hi> and <hi>EÅ¿hallons,</hi> and by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Acts of convention betwixt the two Towns it hath been Å¿tipulated long Å¿ince, that for the preventing of miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underÅ¿tanding betwixt them, their Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of thoÅ¿e common Baillages Å¿hould be left at liberty, to exerciÅ¿e what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion they liÅ¿ted, with this proviÅ¿o, that when any of the communalties Å¿hould require <hi>le plus</hi> (which is as much as putting the queÅ¿tion) it Å¿hould be granted, and if the Catholick party had moÅ¿t voices, then no Religion Å¿hould be exerciÅ¿ed in that juriÅ¿diction, but the Roman, if the ProteÅ¿tants were Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerary
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119672:26"/>then the Catholicks were to yeeld. It hath Å¿o fallen out that the Preachers of the GoÅ¿pel having got the Å¿tart of the PrieÅ¿ts and Friars, <hi>le plus,</hi> hath been demanded Å¿ome years Å¿ince by all thoÅ¿e four Bailliages, and the voices being all in advantage of the reformed religion, Popery hath been utterly exterminated. <hi>Friburg</hi> which hath equal juriÅ¿diction alternatively, cannot endnre this innovation, and the JeÅ¿uits who are potent in that Town have counÅ¿elled a diviÅ¿ion of thoÅ¿e four Bailliages, that two may be for <hi>Berne</hi> intirely to diÅ¿poÅ¿e of as they will, and the other two be left free for <hi>Friburg.</hi> The BerneÅ¿i will not hearken to this motion, but to hold themÅ¿elves Å¿trong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto their capitulation, wiÅ¿ely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eeing, that if they Å¿hould come to a diviÅ¿ion, the FriburgheÅ¿i would drive out the ProteÅ¿tants out of thoÅ¿e two Bailliages, which would touch unto them, and replant the Roman Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                     <p>The Å¿econd is a diÅ¿pute betwixt <hi>Zurick:</hi> and the little Cantons about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Torgaw,</hi> which being morgaged Å¿ome years Å¿ince to <hi>Zurick,</hi> and not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:119672:26"/>redeemed, poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion was taken, the <hi>Zurigani</hi> acknowledged for Å¿overaigns, and the whole Countey reformed and made orthodox. The little Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons inÅ¿tigated by the Nontio and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿uits, do except againÅ¿t the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and becauÅ¿e that cannot be altered as long as <hi>Torgaw</hi> is Å¿ubject to <hi>Zurick,</hi> they do offer to repay the money, which the Zurigani will not accept, as well knowing that the point of religion is onely aimed at.</p>
                     <p>The third and laÅ¿t which I will note, is a controverÅ¿y betwix <hi>Glaris</hi> and <hi>Swits,</hi> about a Bailliage in common betwixt them both. For the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding of this puntilio, it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the Cantons of <hi>Glaris</hi> is miÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party, half of the reformed religion, and the reÅ¿t Catholicks, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tants have in all aÅ¿Å¿emblies of that Canton, more then two thirds of their favour. Betwixt the Canton of <hi>Glaris</hi> and <hi>Switz</hi> by the Capitulations and Charters it is agreed, that in that Bailli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age common betwixt them both, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natively each Canton Å¿hould depute their Bailiff. In vertue of this capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both the Cantons have alternative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:119672:27"/>named their Bailiffs, and I think that <hi>Glaris</hi> being miÅ¿-party did uÅ¿ually name one of their body that was a Catholick, when it appertained unto them to nominate, but it is certain that they have of late choÅ¿en one of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, againÅ¿t whom thoÅ¿e of <hi>Switz</hi> have excepted, onely for being of the religion.</p>
                     <p>TheÅ¿e three controverÅ¿ies are Å¿till kept on foot by the Roman and AuÅ¿trian par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and as they are alwayes debated at the general Dyett, held at <hi>Baden</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the nativity of Saint <hi>Iohn BaptiÅ¿t,</hi> Å¿o they alwayes part without reÅ¿ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any thing upon theÅ¿e particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</p>

That Regiments be kept intire, and quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, not lodging one compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in one place, and another in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 3. That juÅ¿tice be adminiÅ¿tred by their own officers without appeal to the Prince or State whom their Å¿oul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers do Å¿erve. 4. That their men be not commanded to go to any aÅ¿Å¿ault, but onely to guard Towns or trenches, or to fight in battle, in which laÅ¿t caÅ¿e, if the day prove theirs, they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a moneths pay extraordinary. 5. and laÅ¿tly, They may not be made
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119672:29"/>to Å¿erve by Å¿ea, either upon Å¿hips or gallies. They have no publick Å¿tock or treaÅ¿ury, or any common ArÅ¿enac or Magazin of armes, but as every Canton is provided Å¿everally, Å¿o in caÅ¿e of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaÅ¿ion they are to Å¿end a proportion of men paied and furniÅ¿hed with ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of war and victuals. When they do make an offenÅ¿ive war (which is not uÅ¿ual) then Å¿uch Cantons as do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur therein, are to have part in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queÅ¿t, proportionable to what they do contribute.

He did fall at the beginning of his reign into troubleÅ¿ome times, for his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿or <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth did leave him a foÅ¿terchilde of the <hi>Valtelina,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any portion but charge, expence and trouble.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119672:44"/>in whoÅ¿e favour <hi>France, Venice,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> did appear, did put it into the hands of the Church, as into a Å¿an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary. In the election of Pope <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>rban</hi> the French faction had the affirmative and active part, for it was the hand of the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> that did put that Crown upon his head; the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards had onely a paÅ¿Å¿ive and negative part, in not excluding him, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they do account to be great, and he doth eÅ¿teem to be Å¿omething. As Å¿oon as he was enthroned, he did finde his Crown to be full of thorns, for Å¿ome of his promotors did pretend to all that he could give, and all unto Å¿omething; to pleaÅ¿e all, it was impoÅ¿Å¿ible, to diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaÅ¿e any, dangerous, until he had his houÅ¿e Å¿etled, and his friends about him. Being unwilling to diÅ¿oblige <hi>France</hi> and the league, and fearing to offend the Spaniards, he did reÅ¿olve at the firÅ¿t upon a neutrality, conceiving that, to Å¿ute beÅ¿t with his quality of <hi>Padre commune,</hi> and hoping in time to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive unto himÅ¿elf the honour of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating thoÅ¿e differences by way of negotiation. But his expectation was deceived; for by this temporizing the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119672:44"/>
                        <hi>Valielina</hi> was loÅ¿t, not without Å¿ome diÅ¿honour to him, and Å¿o loÅ¿t, that he hath no thanks from the league, and many curÅ¿es from the Spaniards. This pill, although it were very bitter, he would have paÅ¿Å¿ed over, if it had wrought no further; but when the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the ConÅ¿table <hi>d' EÅ¿dignieris</hi> did begin to march into the field, the Spaniards did grow Å¿o clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, that he was inforced to gratifie them in Å¿uch things as they did deÅ¿ire, though perhaps that which he hath done will not turn to their advantage. The things which they did require, were, that he Å¿hould Å¿end his Nephew into <hi>France</hi> to procure a Å¿uÅ¿penÅ¿ion of armes, and that himÅ¿elf Å¿hould arm po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently within his dominions to joyn with them in the defence of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion, and the liberty of <hi>Italy.</hi> TheÅ¿e requeÅ¿ts have been granted, for his Nephew is not in <hi>France,</hi> and he hath raiÅ¿ed, and given order for the raiÅ¿ing of twelve thouÅ¿and foot &amp; two thouÅ¿and horÅ¿e; but what his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to do, is hard to gueÅ¿s. It is certain that if he do love the French and the league but a little, he doth fear
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119672:45"/>the Spaniards much, and therefore theÅ¿e armes of his may be as well to defend himÅ¿elf againÅ¿t them, as to offend any of the league, againÅ¿t whom he doth now profeÅ¿Å¿e that he cannot declare himÅ¿elf, becauÅ¿e <hi>il Å¿uo. pegno, Ã¨ in Francia;</hi> That he will imploy his armes againÅ¿t the league it is unlikely; for although he doth inherit one quality of all his PredeceÅ¿Å¿ors, which is to hate the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, yet he will fear to loÅ¿e by the bargain, conÅ¿idering that the beÅ¿t part of his dominions doth lie open to the Adriatick Å¿ea, of which the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are abÅ¿olute maÅ¿ters, and may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage all his country at their pleaÅ¿ure. That he doth fear the Spaniards, there are Å¿ome probabilities, as his with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the Jubily from the Church of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and Å¿hutting up of that gate which doth lead towards <hi>Naples:</hi> his taking in and railing a garden belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the ConÅ¿table <hi>Colonna,</hi> confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with <hi>Monte Cavallo,</hi> and Å¿eeming a little to command that palace, his having required the Å¿aid <hi>Colonna,</hi> (who is a Roman, but ConÅ¿table of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples</hi> likewiÅ¿e) to deliver into his hands a CaÅ¿tle of his upon the confine
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119672:45"/>betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> and laÅ¿tly, his having commanded all Cardinals and Prelates of quality, to bring their unwrought and unguilded plate unto his exchequer, allowing them upon the Monti (which are certain banks of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in <hi>Rome</hi>) one hundred and twenty four Julij, (which is five pound twelve Å¿hillings Å¿terling) for every pound weight. TheÅ¿e are arguments that he doth fear Å¿ome body, and whom he can fear, but the Spaniards, cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined: for the kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> is at his doore: the French are too far off, the Duk of <hi>Savoy</hi> too weak of himÅ¿elf, and of the Venetians he is Å¿ure that if they may live in peace, they will diÅ¿turb no body: Å¿ome are Å¿o wiÅ¿e as to think, that Å¿ecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he doth underÅ¿tand with <hi>France,</hi> and that he would willingly lay claim un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> if the league would bring the Spaniards Å¿o low, that he might dare to appear; but it doth plainly appear by his MiniÅ¿ters abroad, and their negotiations in all places, that he doth really and diligently Å¿eek to divert the Å¿torm which is threatened unto the GenoeÅ¿i, and by conÅ¿equence unto the Spaniards, whether it be that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:119672:46"/>hope of good from them, or fear of hurt from innovations, or an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be the arbitrator, doth move him none can tell but he who hath the key of hearts. It is likely that he would fain Å¿ee an end of theÅ¿e troubles, becauÅ¿e being a PrieÅ¿t and a Florentine too, he hath no minde to Å¿pend, and although he hath not done yet much for any of his houÅ¿e, yet perhaps he would imitate his predeceÅ¿Å¿ors in that kinde, which he can hardly do untill this Å¿torm be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blown.</p>
                     <p>Untill it Å¿hall appear what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of <hi>Genova</hi> and <hi>Breds,</hi> he will not unmaÅ¿k himÅ¿elf certainly: but it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that according to the event of thoÅ¿e two great enterpriÅ¿es, he may Å¿ail as he Å¿hall finde the winde.</p>

                     <p>THe Venetians did lay the firÅ¿t Å¿tone of this great building, upon which all the preÅ¿ent innovations in theÅ¿e parts are grounded: for they did wiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

In the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Milan,</hi> your MajeÅ¿ties Å¿ubjects Å¿hall always finde entertainment conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto the correÅ¿pondence, that Å¿hall paÅ¿Å¿e betwixt your MajeÅ¿tie and the king of <hi>Spain.</hi> There do remain onely the Venetians and the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> theÅ¿e do properly retain their full liberty, and are able to do your MajeÅ¿tie Å¿ervice, and to offend any that Å¿hall be your enemie. By their means, and with the help of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ters and Å¿ubjects, your MajeÅ¿tie may know whatÅ¿oever is done at Rome, and Å¿ingular uÅ¿e may be made of their friendÅ¿hip, without any coÅ¿t or trouble: for the Venetians will never deÅ¿ire more then to have their AmbaÅ¿Å¿adors kindly uÅ¿ed, and that the world may Å¿ee, and take notice, that your MajeÅ¿tie doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect them, and if upon fit occaÅ¿ions
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119672:56"/>your MajeÅ¿tie will be pleaÅ¿ed to favour the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi> with Å¿ome horÅ¿es and dogs, they will be proud of Å¿uch a token of your love, and be ready to deÅ¿erve it.

                     <hi>Prague,</hi> and <hi>Tilly</hi> having the general command under the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> did not care to fortifie the maritime places of <hi>Pomerany</hi> and <hi>Mechelburg,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e they did belong to <hi>ValleÅ¿tein,</hi> whoÅ¿e ruin the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> did Å¿eek, and if <hi>Tilly</hi> could have been Å¿ure that the king of <hi>Sweden</hi> would have contented himÅ¿elf with the reintegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Dukes of <hi>Mechelbourg,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Pomerany,</hi> and what with the ImperialiÅ¿ts had gotten in the Dutchy of <hi>HolÅ¿tein,</hi> he would never have appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as an enemy, there being nothing that the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and he did deÅ¿ire more then the ruin of <hi>ValleÅ¿tein,</hi> the diÅ¿crediting the Emperour, and the exaltation of the Catholick league which might in due time authorize <hi>Bavaria</hi> to make a king of the Romans according to his own minde, and Å¿tampt at <hi>Munichen.</hi> Now if it be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, it will appear that the king of <hi>Sweden</hi> hath not Å¿pent Å¿o ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months Å¿ince his departure from <hi>Sweden,</hi> and his arrival in <hi>Francony</hi> and <hi>Suevia,</hi> as the ImperialiÅ¿ts did Å¿pend years in conquering North-wards: and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:119672:60"/>the facility of his progreÅ¿Å¿e is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed unto the finger of God, and not unto the arm of fleÅ¿h.</p>
                  <p>This is taken <hi>pro conceÅ¿Å¿o,</hi> that he hath aÅ¿Å¿ured himÅ¿elf of the Baltick Å¿ea for his retraite, that he hath infranchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed <hi>Pomeranie, Mechelbourg,</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tein,</hi> that he hath cleared the beÅ¿t parts of the rivers of <hi>Elbe</hi> and <hi>WeÅ¿er,</hi> that he hath put the Circle of lower <hi>Saxony</hi> in Å¿tate of defence, Å¿ecured the Marquis of <hi>Brandebourg,</hi> Å¿aved the Duke Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> from utter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Å¿eated himÅ¿elf of the BiÅ¿hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks of <hi>Bamberg,</hi> and <hi>Werteberg,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Landgraves of <hi>HeÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> and diÅ¿poÅ¿ed the capital Imperial Towns of <hi>Francony</hi> and <hi>Swevia</hi> to accept him as Protector of the common liberty. This is very much to be done in Å¿o Å¿hort a time, but it was not done <hi>Å¿ine Å¿anguine &amp; Å¿udore;</hi> for when <hi>Tilly</hi> did Å¿ee that the king had paÅ¿Å¿ed the <hi>Elbe,</hi> he did look that way, to Å¿top his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advancing, and upon the confines of that river there did paÅ¿Å¿e many ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters which were very bloudy, but
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:119672:61"/>the main battle was given near <hi>LipÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> wherein God did bleÅ¿Å¿e the king, and our Laity did not favour Tilly. It cannot be denied but that he did the part of a brave General in that bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and in all the former rencounters, &amp; he hath now diÅ¿covered an errour in our ordinary Arithmetick, for that Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra of his, hath Å¿till multiplied by Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿traction, and he is now as Å¿trong as ever he was. It is therefore neceÅ¿Å¿ary that we Å¿hould examin well how things do Å¿tand at the preÅ¿ent, foreÅ¿ee what is likely to inÅ¿ue and deliberate <hi>quid agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In my conceit, things do Å¿tand yet in <hi>aequilibrio,</hi> for although much ground hath been gotten Å¿ince the battle near <hi>LypÅ¿wich,</hi> and the hearts of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men are turned to our favour in deteÅ¿tation of the cruelty which the Imperial CommiÅ¿Å¿aries have uÅ¿ed; yet if the chance of the war do turn in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther battel to our diÅ¿advantage, all that ground is loÅ¿t, and thoÅ¿e people will return <hi>tanquam canes ad vomitum,</hi> let us take it for granted, that the king
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:119672:61"/>of <hi>Sweden</hi> may go into the field with twenty thouÅ¿and foot and five thouÅ¿and horÅ¿e, not counting his garriÅ¿ons. He will be encountered by <hi>Tilly</hi> and <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> with as many, if not more. If the ImperialiÅ¿ts get the day, we may Å¿ay good night, unleÅ¿Å¿e we will deceive our Å¿elves. If the king prevail, it is not Å¿o, for he pretending nothing in <hi>Germany</hi> for himÅ¿elf, but intending the repatriation of divers exiled princes, and proÅ¿cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed States, they will not be able to Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿iÅ¿t Å¿everally of themÅ¿elves without him, nor he be able to maintain his army, if he do give every man is due, and retain nothing unto himÅ¿elf, which may ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to maintain both himÅ¿elf, and thoÅ¿e whoÅ¿e protection he doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. Herein I do finde a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; for if he do live wholy upon the Catholick Princes, our civil diÅ¿putes will terminate in a war of religion; and if he do live upon the ProteÅ¿tants, they will be as weary of him, as they are now of the Emperour: if he do exact from both, he will be in Å¿hort time equally odious to both, who will Å¿ee that they have changed <hi>Dominum
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:119672:62"/>non Å¿ervitutem.</hi> But if the Emperour do loÅ¿e the day, he will not be Å¿o far Å¿treightned: for the reverent reÅ¿pect due unto his Imperial Crown wil alwayes keep in devotion to his Å¿ervice, milions of Å¿ouls, who do deteÅ¿t the barbarous proceedings of his MiniÅ¿ters. Secondly, the hereditary poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ions of thÃ© houÅ¿e of <hi>AuÅ¿tria</hi> yeeld many men, and are of great extenÅ¿ion, which none can take from them in good conÅ¿cience. LaÅ¿tly, the dominions of the king of <hi>Spain</hi> are very vaÅ¿t, and his TreaÅ¿ure of Å¿uch conÅ¿ideration, that it is a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing to think, that he can want mony; for although he doth Å¿omtimee turn banquerupt, when it doth turn him to account; yet he doth alwayes finde mony for his own occaÅ¿ions, and he that hath mony, Å¿hall never want men. His MajeÅ¿ty hath Å¿ent the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>Hamilton</hi> with forces to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> thoÅ¿e are counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballanced by the troups which the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> hath conducted in Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Emperour. The Å¿tates may perhaps aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t the king of <hi>Sweden</hi> with conÅ¿iderable troups, when they have
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:119672:62"/>nothing to do; but it were better for him that they had Å¿omething to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e the Infanta will Å¿end as many to the Emperour as they can Å¿end to him, Å¿o that the ballance doth go equal at preÅ¿ent, but for the future, we have this diÅ¿advantage, that if we have this diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, that if we be once beaten <hi>a Plat couÅ¿ture,</hi> we Å¿hall be worÅ¿e then before <hi>Prague,</hi> and if the Emperour loÅ¿e the day, he will prove like <hi>Anteus,</hi> and riÅ¿e from the ground with new Å¿trength, having a good pulÅ¿e of his patrimony, in the conÅ¿ervation whereof many are intereÅ¿Å¿ed.</p>
                  <p>The point moÅ¿t conÅ¿iderable is, that of <hi>religion,</hi> which we are like to fall upon, although we are to avoid it like a rock. If inevitable neceÅ¿Å¿ity do caÅ¿t us upon that deÅ¿perate coaÅ¿t, we muÅ¿t make account, that at this preÅ¿ent in <hi>Germany</hi> there is much ground poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed by thoÅ¿e who do declare themÅ¿elves on our Å¿ide; and thus much enjoyed by our enemies declared, as may be Å¿een by a Å¿chedule apart, which Å¿hall be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed into this diÅ¿courÅ¿e.</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:119672:63"/>
                  <p>If we do confine our Å¿elves unto <hi>Germany</hi> onely, we Å¿hall get little by the bargain, and if we do go out, we Å¿hall loÅ¿e more. In <hi>Germany</hi> the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks have this great advantage, that they do in <hi>Spiritualibus,</hi> all acknowledge the Pope, and do agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves in doctrine and diÅ¿cipline, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we have nothing but the confeÅ¿Å¿ion of <hi>AuÅ¿bourg,</hi> which doth binde us with Å¿o looÅ¿e a chain, that the names of <hi>CalviniÅ¿ts, Lutherans, HuÅ¿Å¿its</hi> are Å¿till in <hi>eÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> and their, and their hatred one againÅ¿t the other, greater then of them all againÅ¿t the Catholicks. If we do go out of upper <hi>Germany,</hi> there is Great <hi>Brittany, Denmark, Sweden,</hi> and the Å¿tates of the united Provinces, which do come Å¿hort of <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> who will be againÅ¿t us when we Å¿hall come to that point, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this Pope be contrary in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the houÅ¿e of <hi>AuÅ¿tria,</hi> yet he muÅ¿t contribute what may lie in his power, to the maintaining of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, and the like muÅ¿t be preÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med both of the French King, and of the Venetians and Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:119672:63"/>do all wiÅ¿h an abaÅ¿ing of the AuÅ¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aci, but will never endure the increaÅ¿e of our religion in any place where they can hinder it. <hi>Spain</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> may well be left out here, becauÅ¿e it is too well known how they do incline, and if they could agree among themÅ¿elves, perhaps the Duke of <hi>Nivers</hi> and <hi>Mantova</hi> might be their General, with his new order of Militia <hi>ChriÅ¿tiana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have heard Å¿ome Å¿ay, that we muÅ¿t truÅ¿t to our Å¿elves, and never expect any good from Catholicks; the firÅ¿t I grant, but I denie the Å¿econd. I will Å¿ay thoÅ¿e men are very wiÅ¿e that will demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trate how ProteÅ¿tants thorowout <hi>Europe</hi> Å¿ubÅ¿iÅ¿t without Å¿upport of Catholicks; but if we can be without them, it is good, becauÅ¿e they are to us like a lake of <hi>Anecie,</hi> which doth yeeld fiÅ¿h all the yeer, but in lent, as theÅ¿e may Å¿erve us at all times, but when we have moÅ¿t need of them. Here we may put into our Å¿cale, thoÅ¿e of the religion in <hi>France,</hi> whoÅ¿e relicks are Å¿omething numerous, <hi>quantum ad individua,</hi> but they are
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:119672:64"/>light grains, and of no greater conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration Å¿ince the integrity of their body hath been diÅ¿Å¿olved and broken, their fortifications demoliÅ¿hed, and their leaders either Å¿educed or exiled, Å¿o Å¿o that nothing can be expected from them, but the aid of Å¿ome few volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, whoÅ¿e zeal may tranÅ¿port them to offer their Å¿ervice unto Å¿uch as do or may appear in this cauÅ¿e, and the prayers of the Churches, and good wiÅ¿hes of all true ProteÅ¿tants.</p>
                  <p>There is yet another thing of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conÅ¿ideration, which doth make for us, and that is the difference among Catholicks for civil reÅ¿pects, which wil in part help to counterpoiÅ¿e the miÅ¿un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tandings of our religionaries in <hi>Germany,</hi> of which before I have Å¿po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; though <hi>France</hi> hath not hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Å¿o viÅ¿ibly aÅ¿pired to an univerÅ¿al Monarchy, as <hi>Spain</hi> is Å¿aid to have done, (perhaps unjuÅ¿tly) it is apparent that their perpetuall domeÅ¿tick broville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have hindered them from execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and perhaps from projecting any Å¿uch vaÅ¿t deÅ¿ignes. But it is certain,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:119672:64"/>that either envy, or emulation, or reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal jealouÅ¿ie have bred Å¿uch an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy betwixt thoÅ¿e two nations, that though they are unwilling to break, yet they will alway diÅ¿agree, unleÅ¿Å¿e the crucifying of our Saviour do recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate.</hi> This emulation of theÅ¿e two Crowns doth breed as great a diÅ¿traction of the Catholick body in Europe, as may be equivalent to the diÅ¿union of our body in <hi>Germany,</hi> only herein they have the advantage of us, that their quarels being purely ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil are more accommodable of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves, and that they have the Pope for <hi>Padre communÃ©,</hi> unto whom they do willingly remit the arbitrement of their differences, when they are both Å¿o weary of making war that they do not care upon what conditions any peace be made <hi>pro interim;</hi> whereas our differences in matter of religion, are more irreconcilable; for although the parties may agree in the ground of a ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion, yet differences of opinions do prove conÅ¿cientious in matter of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and opiniaÅ¿tretes in thoÅ¿e who do every one of them abound in their own
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:119672:65"/>Å¿ence, can never be reduced to temper, much leÅ¿Å¿e to regularity, eÅ¿pecially there wanting a head on our Å¿ide, who might call an univerÅ¿al Councel, and by coactive power inforce conformity unto what Å¿hould be decreed by the major part of Princes.</p>
                  <p>I do not bring in the king of <hi>Poland</hi> into any part of our account, becauÅ¿e although it be wel known he doth Å¿tand affected, yet it is certain that he hath onely <hi>voluntatem liberam &amp; poteÅ¿tatem ligatam</hi> at this preÅ¿ent, Å¿o that he can do no great hurt, nor good.</p>
                  <p>There is an other circumÅ¿tance which doth make againÅ¿t us, namely, that the preÅ¿ent viÅ¿ible Å¿upportation of our cauÅ¿e doth lie upon the king of <hi>Swedens</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on onely, whom none but God can Å¿ecure from AÅ¿Å¿aÅ¿Å¿inates; and if he Å¿hould miÅ¿carry, we Å¿hould be to Å¿eek, whereas the ImperialiÅ¿ts, and Catholicks have more Å¿trings to their bow then one. But in caÅ¿e God do protect him from treaÅ¿on intended, and that he do give him farther victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he cannot but live with Å¿ome little
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:119672:65"/>anxiety, for fear leÅ¿t the king of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> retaining the memory of old quarels, Å¿hould come behinde him, and that the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> Å¿hould fall from him, and accommodate with the Emperour. AgaiuÅ¿t theÅ¿e I have no graines of civil conÅ¿iderations to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, but muÅ¿t hope that God who hath made choice of him to fight his battles, will alwayes aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t him from open and Å¿ecret enemies, and either by him, or Å¿ome other whom God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf will chuÅ¿e, will perfect the work that he hath begun.</p>
                  <p>If this model of the preÅ¿ent Å¿tate of affaires be juÅ¿t, or doth come neer unto rectitude, then in the Å¿ame glaÅ¿Å¿e which doth Å¿hew unto us the preÅ¿ent face of things, we way foreÅ¿ee what is likely to be the event, as far as any thing may be conjectured <hi>de futuris contingentibus,</hi> the certainty of which is known onely to God, All that can be Å¿aid in this Å¿ubject, muÅ¿t be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced unto two heads; namely the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of all differences, all ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, or the continuance of the war;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119672:66"/>this being to be underÅ¿tood onely of <hi>Germany,</hi> which Province at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent is the onely <hi>Sedes belli,</hi> it is hard to Å¿ay which of theÅ¿e two is the moÅ¿t likely to inÅ¿ue in the firÅ¿t place; for although it may be granted, that peace is deÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on both Å¿ides, yet the concluding thereof will prove a hard reÅ¿ultate; firÅ¿t in regard of the proximity of the armies, which can hardly be contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from enterÅ¿chaking when they come to a reaÅ¿onable diÅ¿tance; Å¿econd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in regard of the diÅ¿perÅ¿ion of the armies, which being divided in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces far off, cannot eaÅ¿ily agree upon a Å¿urÅ¿eance of armes univerÅ¿al, if any Å¿uch thing Å¿hould be accorded in any one place: Thirdly, becauÅ¿e neither the one party nor the other can long live <hi>en gros</hi> upon the PaiÅ¿ant, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muÅ¿t <hi>es loigne</hi> themÅ¿elves, or diÅ¿pute their bread with their Å¿words. Fourthly wee do not heare as yet of any Mediator, neither can we know where to finde one that may be truÅ¿ted of both parties.</p>
                  <p>for although the French king would
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119672:66"/>perhaps derive unto himÅ¿elf that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yet the animoÅ¿ity that he hath and doth Å¿till expreÅ¿Å¿e againÅ¿t <hi>Spain</hi> and the houÅ¿e of <hi>AuÅ¿tria,</hi> will hinder him from being truÅ¿ted by them, and the partiality that is diÅ¿covered in him toward <hi>Bavaria</hi> and the Catholick League will make him Å¿uÅ¿pected by us. This office would Å¿tand beÅ¿t with his MajeÅ¿ty, if he were not in a manner a party; for although in this conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture he might interpoÅ¿e very oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely betwixt the king of <hi>Sweden</hi> and the AuÅ¿triaci, yet <hi>Bavaria</hi> and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick electors will hardly admit of him for what doth concern their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿ts. the one in regard of the <hi>electorat &amp; Palatinate,</hi> the others in regard of difference in religion, The peace or truce in the low Countries, will prove a knotty piece of work, and without that the peace of <hi>Germany</hi> can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be concluded; Again there is an other dfficulty in regard of a new war likely to begin in <hi>Italy,</hi> which will cauÅ¿e the French to diÅ¿turb the quiet of the AuÅ¿triaci in <hi>Germany</hi>
                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:119672:67"/>as much as they Å¿hall be able, and to traverÅ¿e likewiÅ¿e any Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the low countryes: LaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> having now with <hi>Tilly</hi> the command of the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial or Catholick army, it is likely that they will both incline to war, the one to purchaÅ¿e the electorate of <hi>Brande-bourg</hi> (which is promiÅ¿ed unto him) and the other to have his revenge, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been beaten.</p>
                  <p>All that can be Å¿aid on the other Å¿ide, is that both parties may be Å¿o weary of the war, that they may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deÅ¿ire Peace upon any conditions then hazard new Battles, which are journiaillers. Secondly that the queÅ¿ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Palatinate whereupon the quarrel is grounded, may Å¿eem unto Å¿ome of eaÅ¿y belief to approach near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the point of accomodation, conÅ¿ider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Spain</hi> hath undertaken to diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e the Emperour on the one Å¿ide (how reall I know not) and that <hi>France</hi> doth Å¿eem willing to diÅ¿poÅ¿e <hi>Bavaria</hi> on
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119672:67"/>the otherÅ¿ide, to accommodate with us upon any reaÅ¿onable conditions.</p>
                  <p>LaÅ¿tly that the Abbate <hi>Scaglia</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in his hands the negotiation of Peace or Truce with the States of the united Provinces, it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿umed that he may effect as much as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ney</hi> did heretofore.</p>
                  <p>If theÅ¿e Landmarks be not miÅ¿taken, we may conclude that in probability <hi>&amp; quoad hominem</hi> it is more likely that the war will continue then any Peace be agreed upon, and therefore taking that for granted, it will now be time for us to take into conÅ¿ideration <hi>quid agendum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before I enter upon that diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courÅ¿e, I will in one word mrake <hi>quid non agendum,</hi> namely, that we be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aboue all things not to break off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Treaties that are or may be Å¿et on foot for the accomodation of the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate how captious and eluÅ¿ory Å¿o e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they may be, it being good to keep
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119672:68"/>them up, as long as they do do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muÅ¿e us, and that we do not truÅ¿t unto them but put in lucro any benefit that may unexpectedly come by them, and therefore it will be very neceÅ¿Å¿ary to diÅ¿poÅ¿e the king of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> not to Å¿tir as yet, nor to appear in perÅ¿on (as he doth Å¿eem to intend) for very good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pects and conÅ¿iderations.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that to much paÅ¿Å¿ion be not expreÅ¿Å¿ed on our Å¿ide in favour of the Queen mother, or MonÅ¿ieur, un-until our preÅ¿ent negotiations here be conÅ¿ummated (which will be very Å¿hort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>fait ou failli</hi>) and that we may Å¿ee more clearly how they will govern themÅ¿elves towards the king of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> which will be a Å¿hort work, conÅ¿idering that their aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ting of <hi>Bavaria</hi> will be a Å¿ecourÅ¿e of <hi>PiÅ¿a,</hi> if it be not Å¿peedy, and that both the king of <hi>Sweden</hi> and the States do call upon them now very inÅ¿tantly for 5000. livers due unto each at the end of this moneth, and therefore theÅ¿e wil prove good <hi>pietre di parangona,</hi> and make us Å¿ee how their pulÅ¿e doth beat.</p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:119672:68"/>
                  <p>The territories and Citties of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿tants and PapiÅ¿ts in <hi>Germany,</hi> are at this preÅ¿ent Å¿o interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, (moÅ¿t of the Princes of each Religion having in their poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion Å¿ome places of the contrary party) that it will be difficult to make an accurate Geomatrical diviÅ¿ion, and diÅ¿tinction of them.</p>
